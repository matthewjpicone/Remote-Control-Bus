# Remote-Control-Bus: A 1:18 Scale Articulated Model Bus

### Introduction
In November 2020, I purchased my first 3D printer, and after printing a lot of designs from Thingiverse, I decided to create a remote control bus using Fusion 360. After 141 successful prints, and a few failed attempts, I completed the model. I went through several iterations of electronic designs until I settled on the final one, with separate controllers and PWM drivers to allow for easy separation of the bus. The bus features six OLED displays, functional doors, and realistic lights and decals.

### Design and Construction
The construction of the bus was challenging but rewarding. I had to overcome many difficulties, including etching PCBs at home, drilling holes, and soldering boards. The code is designed as a Master/Slave setup, with everything communicating through IIC. The project is controlled using a PlayStation 2 controller, with the master checking for inputs from the controller and sending a command to the slave to execute anything not directly connected.

### Features and Improvements
The finished 1:18 scale articulated model bus boasts many impressive features, such as functioning doors and realistic lights. The diagnostic display in the rear door will display live information from the main controller in the next version of the project. The rear internal panel contains two barrel jacks for charging and master kill switches for the two battery packs on board. Despite some challenges during construction, such as issues with weight and finding suitable gearboxes, the final product is remarkable. Future improvements for version 2 include a web server, flexible resin curtains, addressable LED lights, larger screens, resin printed corners for the windscreen, more efficient and robust code, and a lighter design achieved by printing bigger, thinner parts.

### Conclusion
Months of testing and playing around resulted in the first prototype, which was a great success. I learned a lot during this project, including the importance of addressable LEDs, which could have saved me a lot of time. Overall, the knowledge and experience gained have been invaluable.
